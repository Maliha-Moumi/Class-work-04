	      <h2>Facebook Marketing</h2> 
    <p>If you’re a brand hoping to thrive on social media, mastering Facebook marketing is going to be key.More than 2.8 billion people use the platform every single month. That’s a lot of potential eyeballs on your business.Because here’s the thing about Facebook: while you might think it’s just a place where your aunt can leave cryptic comments on your vacation pics, it’s also a place for audiences to connect with businesses big and small.In fact, two-thirds of Facebook users report visiting a local business Facebook Page at least once a week. This digital marketplace is downright bustling, if it’s not too bold of us to say.</p>

    	     <h2>Linkedin Marketing</h2>
    <p>LinkedIn is less about selling or marketing your products and services than other social platforms. On LinkedIn, blatantly pushing your business, spamming and obvious hard-selling are highly frowned upon. This is why having a marketing strategy specific to the platform is so important. Because the network consists of a totally different audience, LinkedIn marketing requires a different approach to get the results you want.According to Sprout Social, businesses marketing on LinkedIn generate 277% more leads on average than those engaged in Facebook marketing alone. Surveyed B2B marketers also said that LinkedIn is responsible for 80% of their social media leads. Used appropriately, LinkedIn is an effective marketing tool that can take your business to the next level.</p>
